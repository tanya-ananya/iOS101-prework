## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Favorite Features**
App ONE: iMessage
- Can unsend messages
- Can edit messages
- Shows message timestamps
App TWO: Google Maps
- Easy to use UI
- Has many different versions and gives a lot of control to the user in terms of changing the map's looks
App THREE: Netflix
- The app uses the same UI throughout all devices, maintaining consistency and familiar UI for users
- The 'New and Hot' feature is fun to scroll through for recommendations

**App Idea:**
One app I want to redesign would be Amazon's storefront. Right now, it can seem intimdating and overwhelming for new users--expecially the settings page where it takes a long time to find something even with the search feature. To redesign it, I would offer options for the UI between compact and more spaced apart options for the users to click. Another feature I would change would be the amount of content shown in the settings page--I would try to find ways to condense the information and available options to go through.

## Notes

The instructions were pretty hard to navigate, it even seemed to be working with older models and the same features shown in the instructions were in different spots. For example, the instruction in step 3 said the "Storyboard file" when in reality, the exact buttons to get to this file were to click on the panel and open "assistant". It was hard to navigate as a new user to Xcode.
